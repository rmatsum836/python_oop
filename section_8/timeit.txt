# Benchmarking with timeit

- "Benchmarking" means comparing two code snippets to see which
  executes faster
- Time and memory are often not a concern to us, but it is to some
  Python programmers
- Time tests should be run multiple times
- Tests should consider the context in which they will run
- Benchmarking is something of an art
- timeit.timeit: setup: import packages and variables to run
- Suggested not to take an average, take the lowest time of the
  multiple runs
