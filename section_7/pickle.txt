# Object serialization and Pickle

- serialization: perisistant storage, to disk
- relational storage writes data to tables (relational database txt files)
- object-based storage stores objects as they are used in code
- object-relational mappings can mediate between the two
- pickle: package in python to store an object to disk
- `pickle.dumps` and `pickle.loads` stores and loads objects as strings
- Instances of a class can also be pickled
- pickling doesn't store code, but refers to them
- not human readable
- cPickle is a fastr, C-compiled implementation
