# YAML

- YAML: yaml ain't markup language
- serializes python objects, like pickle or JSON
- Uses whitespace to separate elements, extremely readable
- List and tuple are stored the same way, tuple needs to be denoted
- YAML will handle and process an object automatically
- instances can be stored, but code needs to be referred to like pickling
