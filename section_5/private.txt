# Private Variable Names
- There is no real privacy in python
- Some PEP8 conventions:
    - Module names: all_lower_case
    - class names and exceptions: CamelCase
    - Globals and locals: all_lower_case
    - Functions and methods: all_lower_case
    - contants: ALL_CAPS
- "Private" attributes or variables should begin with single leading
  underscore
- "Magic" attributes have double underscores (Use them, don't create
  them)
