# Composition vs Inheritance
- Inheritance can be brittle, meaning a change may require changes elsewhere
- Creates dependencies
- Decoupled code: Classes, functions, et.c that work independently and don't
  depend on one another
- As long as the interface is maintained, interactions between classes will
  work
- Not checking or requiring particular types is polymorphic and pythonic
