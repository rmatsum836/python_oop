# Inheriting the Constructor

- __init__ can be inherited like any other method
- If a class doesn't have an __init__ constructor, python will check
  its parent class to see if it can find one
- Call parent class constructor with `super` in child class
  constructor
- super is a built-in function
- `super` keeps thing modular and easier to maintain
