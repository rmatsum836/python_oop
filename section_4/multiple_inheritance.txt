# Multiple Inheritance

- When a child class inherits from multiple parent classes
- Depth-first or breadth-first? By default, python uses a depth-first
  lookup for an attribute
- For "diamond shape" inheritance, inheritance is ambiguous.  Removes
  earlier occurance of a class that appears twice in an order
- Can find out lookup order by calling `mro()` method
