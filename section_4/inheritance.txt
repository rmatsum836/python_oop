# Inheriting Attributes

- Inheritance: second pillar of OOP
- Classes can inherit from other classes, including attributes and
  methods
- `object`: Built-in object in python
- Inheritance adds another layer in lookup hierarchy: instance, class,
  any class from which class inherits
- Inheritance Examples:
    - inherit: simply use the parent class' defined method
    - override: provide child's own version of a method
    - extend: do work in addition to that in parent's method
    - provide: implement abstract method that parent requires
