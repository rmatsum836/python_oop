# Decorators, Static and Class Methods

- Bound method: Method that is bound to instance of class, (self) is
  an argument
- Class method: Method intended work with class (replace `self` with
  `cls`) and add `@classmethod`
- Decorator: Special function to modify functions
- Static method: `@staticmethod` decorator, utility class that doesn't
  work with either class or instance
- The `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod` modify the default binding
  that instance methods provide
